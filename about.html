    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <p>At Wonderlust, we believe that the perfect vacation isn’t a one-size-fits-all 
     experience—it’s a dream tailored just for you! Our travel website is designed
     to take the guesswork out of planning your next adventure. Whether you’re longing 
     for the thrill of an African safari, the magic of the Northern Lights, or the 
     crisp powder of an Alpine ski trip, we’ve got you covered.</p>

    <h2>How it Works</h2>
     <p>Here’s how it works: Wonderlust starts with a fun, easy-to-navigate questionnaire 
        that gets to know you. Are you a beach bum seeking sunny shores, or a night owl who 
        craves vibrant nightlife? Is your heart set on tranquil getaways or adrenaline-pumping
         expeditions? Share your preferences—budget, travel dates, and dream destinations—and 
         let us work our magic. Our matching system pairs you with trips that align 
         perfectly with your travel style. Think of us as your personal travel genie, 
         ready to help you explore the world, one unforgettable journey at a time.</p>

        <p>Your next great adventure is only a few clicks away!</p>
